            Aperium Technology is a fintech that started after two friends decided to put their complementary skills together to create a fantastic tool for the cryptocurrency market. One of them holds strong systems engineering skills and the other
            is a financial expert. The challenge was to develop an automated trading tool that could work 24/7 in a market that simply doesn't sleep. The foremost idea was to work with main liquid markets applying non-emotional algorithmic trading .
            <br />In less than six months the first prototype was born. The initial idea became a reality, main features were in place, well tested, and the application was running smoothly. Of course that did not happen without a lot of daily
            effort
            to
            make the platform faster and smarter.
            <br />At this point, we have a continuous set of ideas and features in pipeline for next releases. Check upcoming features or make suggestions in our contact channels.
            <br />Our team is always ready to help and if you have a question or a suggestion, do not hesitate to get in touch.

              <b>Ozzy the French Bulldog! </b>
              He is cute, friendly and usually doesn't bark instead snores and grunts which is pretty funny :)
              <br />He makes a lot success when going for a walk in the neighborhood.
              <br />His main characteristic is adaptability and trustability just like the Aperium Trader.
              He brings luck to everyone that is friendly and kind.
